### Bot Operation Steps
The bot will always bet on T and place the amount you specify. If it loses, the bot will double the bet until it wins.
After winning, it will reset to the original amount you specified.

#### How to Use

1. Open the file `Bot-roulette.exe`.

2. For first-time use, name the Chrome profile (multiple profiles can be created).

3. Log in to CSGOEmpire (you do not need to log in again when using the same Chrome profile next time).

4. Make sure Chrome is on the Roulette page (https://csgoempire.com/roulette).

5. Enter the amount you want to bet (it is recommended to bet only 1% of your total balance).

6. Let the bot run; do not minimize the screen. If you need to use your computer, you can follow step 7.

7. To use your computer while allowing the bot to continue working, press `Win + Tab` to create a new window.
You can then use your computer in that new window.
